Ima navigates to the website and sees the main page.

At the top of the page is a menu with a pulldown on the left side.

The pulldown contains, among its options, an option for Character Generation.

Ima selects this option, and is taken to a new page.

This page has a scrollable list of RPG systems, a button for initializing the character generation, and a message.

The message mentions the need to log in to preserve work, and otherwise has instructions on what to do.

Ima clicks the initialize button without selecting a system, only to find that it does nothing in that case.

Ima looks at the list of systems and sees an entry for "Wayward".  Ima selects this and clicks the initialize button.

Ima is taken to a new screen with a large form to fill out.
