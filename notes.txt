Notes for blinkwink

File structure:

site - Holds everything for the site
  static - Holds static content
    css - Holds static CSS
    img - Holds static images
    js - Holds static JS
  templates - Holds the page templates
  blog.py - Flask app controller
  sql.py - Sets up the initial database
  blog.db - The database



Configuration
Say you have the main flask app as:
  app = Flask(__name__)

Say you want to configure it with the name of a database.

app.config.from_object(__name__)

This will search for any capitalized variables and add them to the config

DATABASE = "name_of_db.db"

We can then use that elsewhere:

app.config["DATABASE"] => "name_of_db.db"



Storing credentials in the code itself is bad
Having an external config that isn't uploaded with the repo and then reading that in is better
Having a dummy config that does get sent to the repo is best (can use it in the future to rebuild if need be)
See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43565371/would-posting-my-code-to-github-affect-the-security-of-my-application/43565435



The use of Flask's g object is useful for messing with database connections
g.db = connect_db() # connect_db() sets up a db connection elsewhere
g.db.execute
or g.db.close()
g is wiped clean after each request.

    Broadcast/Public/Private distinction
        Default is private
        Simple switch to toggle between private and public
        Separate switch to toggle between public and broadcast
        Broadcast
            Tone is a nice blue
            Links are available as "related" to other people who are viewing links
            Browsing links in general will list broadcast links only
        Public
            Tone is a mid-to-dark green
            Links are viewable when looking at a specific person who you're not logged in as
            Links do not show up in general browsing
        Private
            Tone is a dark orange
            Links are only visible to the owner
            Links do not show up in general browsing or when looking at a person who you're not logged in as
    Detect duplicates
        Two different people can have the same link and it is not a duplicate
        One person with the same link twice will result in both links being flagged as possible duplication
        Can prune off ends of URLS (all the GET stuff, ?foo=bar things) to broaden the definition a bit
        Can limit things to exact URL copies only to restrict the definition a bit
            This is the default detection level
        Allows opening of links directly to other tabs in order to check if they are or are not duplicates
        Non-duplicate flag
            Say three links are detected as duplicated
            Say two of them are the same page, but the third is different
            You can select the third and mark is as a non-duplicate
            This will explicitly add the other two pages to a list of non-duplicate links
            The third link is no longer flagged as a duplicate of the first two
            The first two remain flagged as duplicates of eachother
    Detect children pages
        Two links that start with the same URL up to the TLD are detected as related
        If they diverge at the same point, they are siblings
        If one is a subset of the other, it is a child
    Descriptions
        Short descriptions, one or two sentences only.
