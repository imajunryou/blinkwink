        <p>Above you will find a short presentation on the San Juan islands.  I collaborated with a fellow classmate toward our mutual goal of learning about and reporting on a National Historical site.  It was pretty fun to present, and I managed to learn a bunch of neat new things about a place in the world.</p>
        <p>My classmate and I split the workload fairly evenly, overall.  I handled the overall layout and design of the presentation, at first, but we both tweaked, added, and moved things about as needed.</p>
        <p>Much of the actual content was researched by both of us independently as we had some coordination issues with trying to schedule good meeting times, so it is hard to point to stuff that explicitly just one person or the other did.  Much of the footage about the wildlife of the islands and the layout of the camps were put together by me.  Much of the timeline of events, and the hard numbers and dates were put together by my classmate.</p>
        <p>There were many details that made their way into the presentation itself which did not make it into the slideshow.  There were some minor theatrical bits, such as dressing up in period clothing.  The above slideshow holds the bulk of the content, but do not mistake it for 100% of the content.</p>

        <p>Along the way to making this project, I learned many things about the San Juan Islands, and the history around them.  For example, I was unaware that the Oregon treaty of 1846 left vague the territorial claims of the waterways between Washington and Vancouver.  I had also never heard of the Pig War, which stretched for over a decade, and involved hundreds of British and American soldiers gathering on the island over a dispute between farmers.  Overall, there were dozens of historical tidbits that I was not previously aware of, and I'm happy to have had the opportunity and incentive to dig into them a bit.</p>
        <p>Completion of this project involved a few stages, which started slow and spaced out, and accelerated into something more fluid as we neared our deadline.</p>
        <p>We each started by contacting the National Historical site, itself, and requesting some information about it.  Pamphlets, and posters, and informational booklets, mostly.  We did this, in part, because of the requirements of the project itself, but also because such pamphlets are specifically designed to relay dense amounts of information about the site in an understandable way.  The employees on the other end of the line were kind, and informative, and sent us a lovely selection of documents.  It took them time to arrange the shipment, however, and we were not idle.</p>
        <p>After the request for information was put in, the next major step was getting a broad skeleton of the project put together in order to have a framework to work from.  We assembled a shared document to outline three sets of overlapping information:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>The requirements of the project itself, what information we actually needed to cover at minimum.</li>
            <li>Information about the geography, history, and ecology of the site; what would become the actual content.</li>
            <li>Loose organization and categorization of the above information into the shape of our slideshow.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Together, we fleshed out the first point by going over the project requirements together, and expanding on some broad ideas for what sort of details might apply.  Separately, then, we filled in the other two bits through a combination of research and brainstorming.  I started the initial presentation, and defined the initial layout, and my classmate expanded upon that skeleton with gusto.  Most of this time was spent simply adding in however much information we had on hand, without much of a focus on actually organizing or presenting it.  A fast first draft would lend itself to fine tuning and reorganizing.</p>
        <p>With large portions of the template filled in, we received documents from the National Historical site, and proceeded to integrate some of the new information into the slideshow.  This took the form of influencing many of the images we ended up using in the presentation, along with adding bits of flavor to our talk, which didn't make it into the slideshow proper.</p>
        <p>In the end, we spent a few more hours finalizing the layout, filling in the remaining gaps, and deciding which of us would present which aspects of the information.  The final bit of work went into a rehearsal where we simply presented to an empty hallway while waiting for our time to come up.  It helped shake off some nerves, and make it easier to actually segue into the additional content that wasn't directly in the slideshow itself.</p>
        <p>Over the course of this assignment, and really, this class, I have learned a large amount of information.  It has synced well with some of my other classes.  For example, we had many opportunities to think critically about the causes and outcomes of various historical events.  This lent itself to a nice stretching of the material I was picking up in my class on reasoning.  Past classes fed nicely into this one, as well, such as my class on film and culture, which gave me some grounding and tools for properly reviewing the many videos on historical topics throughout the semester.</p>
        <p>All in all, I have enjoyed this semester, and this project in particular.  I feel that I have improved my understanding of the world at least a little bit, and have perhaps discovered a budding interest in economics.</p>
