  <h3>Reflections on Evolution</h3>

<div>
  <p>I accept the theory of evolution for several reasons.  It has been the only explanation that I've come across which clearly explains details of the world around me.  It seems to explain how <a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/antibacterial-soap-you-can-skip-it-use-plain-soap-and-water">antibacterial soap</a> may cause <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/about.html">more problems</a> than it solves, and how giraffes have nerves running a <a class=" inline_disabled" href="https://youtu.be/cO1a1Ek-HD0">giant loop</a> down and up their necks for what is a short jump between two points in their heads.  It also appears to be almost <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Steve">universally accepted</a> by the scientific community, and like with many things in life, such consensus is a <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/R8YpYTq8LoD3k948L/trusting-expert-consensus">useful shorthand</a> given my lack of time for digging into the deep guts of the topic myself (though I am working on taking classes to smooth the edges of my ignorance as best I can).</p>

  <p>My experience with the topic of evolution is shallow.  I have covered the loose basics through biology classes in high school.  I have read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greatest_Show_on_Earth:_The_Evidence_for_Evolution">books</a> and watched <a class=" inline_disabled" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uga0QaKsdCk">talks</a> by Richard Dawkins, who is an evolutionary biologist, and vocal about the theory of evolution.  I have also come across the topic of evolution sideways, through blogs about <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/s/MH2b8NfWv22dBtrs8">rationality</a>, or <a href="https://blog.sicara.com/getting-started-genetic-algorithms-python-tutorial-81ffa1dd72f9?gi=64c1e43ecdd9">computer science</a>.  Up to this point, I have not had any classes specifically dedicated to the theory of evolution.</p>

  <p>I think having an understanding of evolutionary theory can have an impact in everyday life, at a few different levels.  Straightforwardly, the efficacy of antibiotics and medications relies directly on the theory of evolution.  If the theory was not accurately describing reality, the pharmaceutical industry would adapt its methods of research as a matter of simple economics.  Closer to home, those same sort of decisions affect whether or not I decide to get an antibacterial soap when restocking the bathroom soap dispenser.</p>

  <p>More philosophically, evolution gives us a means of exploring our origins, and the origins of all life on Earth.  It fills me with a certain sense of wonder to realize that, on a literal level, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_sea_fish">fish in the deep ocean</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poaceae#Lawn_and_ornamental_use">grass making up my lawn</a>, and hardy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinococcus_radiodurans">extremophiles</a> are all cousins to each other, and to myself.</p>

  <p>I find an understanding of evolutionary theory to be important in another way, as well.  Having an understanding of what evolution is and is <em>not</em> responsible for is important when attempting to develop models of intelligence.  This interests me because building better artificial intelligences would be both extraordinarily <a href="http://yudkowsky.net/singularity/power/">valuable</a>, and probably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Catastrophic_Risks_(book)">crazy</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies">dangerous</a>.  Also, it seems <a class=" inline_disabled" href="https://youtu.be/8nt3edWLgIg">likely to happen</a>.  Going into it with a firm idea about what minds <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tnWRXkcDi5Tw9rzXw/the-design-space-of-minds-in-general">can look like</a>, what sort of minds can come from <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Cyj6wQLW6SeF6aGLy/the-psychological-unity-of-humankind">evolutionary processes</a>, and what sort of minds we might <a href="https://intelligence.org/2017/04/12/ensuring/">actually want</a> seems important.</p>
