At the top of the page is a menu with a pulldown on the left side.

The pulldown contains, among its options, an option for Rithmomachy.

Ima clicks on the Rithmomachy option, and is taken to a new page.

This page has the same menu header at the top.

This page has a board displayed in the center of the screen, initially empty.

The board is 8x16 squares, oriented such that the width is greater than the height.

There is a button below the board titled "Play".
